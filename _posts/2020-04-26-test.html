<p>
    When using Apache Camel with Quarkus as of today, we are limited to a number of Camel connectors. An important one, being
    the Apache Kafka connector.
    The Kafka connector provided through the Smallrye Kafka Extension is available for Quarkus though. So in this
    article, I will show how to
    wire the Smallrye Kafka connector and Camel together.
    We will also be using the camel-servlet component to reuse the undertow http endpoint provided by Quarkus. To
    spice things up a little we will use the XML DSL of Camel.
    All of this will be natively compiled in the end.
