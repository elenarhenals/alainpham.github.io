<h4>Hello my fellow R enthusiasts and welcome to my R blog !</h4>

<p>
My name is Elena Rhenals, and I love data and R. I will try to put these two passions of mine together to produce practical and useful content that can help my readers solve their data problems.
</p>

<p>
I am a data scientist currently working as a data analytics and automation consultant at a large public accounting firm.
I specialize in compliance and risk analytics, including AML, fraud, and fair lending, for financial institutions of all sizes. 
</p>

<p>
Outside of work and my extracurricular data-related activities (such as this), I do a lot of crafts and DIY stuff. This year, I finished painting a Picasso style portrait of my husband, created my first succulent arrangement, rebuilt my closet, sewed homemade face masks (of course!), and got myself utterly addicted to Pinterest.
